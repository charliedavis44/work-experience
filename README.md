Question 1- Which machine type is used most?







# Second Task
Levels of measurement video

  Nominal/Qualitative - descriptions or labels with no order eg. Colour

  Ordinal- Have a meaningful Order
  eg. Satisfaction
  Gaps may not be equal eg. positions in a race therefore mean cannot be calculated

  Interval/Ratio- Data that can be numbered and mean can be calculated

  Labour hours is rounded but continuous so averages can be calculated.

  Issue with using hours to measure performance as in some cases it is harder to fix the engine than others. If difficulty of the job was factored in, that would give a better metric.
